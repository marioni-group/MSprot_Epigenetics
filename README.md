# MSprot_Epigenetics

Code for "Methylome-wide association studies and epigenetic biomarker development for 133 mass spectrometry-assessed circulating proteins in 14,761 Generation Scotland participants".

This includes epigenome-wide association studies of 133 mass spectrometry proteins using a marginal linear method (OSCA) and a penalised Bayesian method (GMRMomi). It also includes creation of protein EpiScores using a penalised Bayesian method (GMRMomi) and analysis of these in association with incident cardiovascular disease.

The two folders contain code for separate analyses as follows: 

•	Marginal linear EWAS (OSCA) – ewas/osca_ewas

•	Penalised Bayesian EWAS (GMRM) – ewas/gmrmomi_ewas/

•	Protein EpiScores (GMRM) – episcores/
